This is my take on the Tea Cozy assigment of Codecademy. It is part of the Web Development Fundamentals course. This assignment focuses on CSS flexbox usage in combination with previously gained knowledge on CSS and HTML. See the file 'img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg' for the specs that the student has to use. Pictures are made available by Codecademy
