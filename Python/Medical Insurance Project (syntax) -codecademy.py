# USING FORMULAS

# You are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs. 
# Using a formula that estimates a personâ€™s yearly insurance costs, you will investigate 
# how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction.


# create the initial variables below

age = 28
sex = 0  # female
bmi = 26.2
num_of_children = 3
smoker = 0 # non-smoker


# Add insurance estimate formula below

insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children +  24000 * smoker - 12500 

print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.") # 5469.0



# Age Factor
age += 4

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children +  24000 * smoker - 12500 

print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(new_insurance_cost) + " dollars.") # 6469.0

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print("The change in cost of insurance after increasing the age by 4 years is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")



# BMI Factor

age = 28
bmi += 3.1

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children +  24000 * smoker - 12500
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing BMI by 3.1 is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")


# Male vs. Female Factor
bmi = 26.2
sex = 1  # male

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children +  24000 * smoker - 12500
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated cost for being male instead of female is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")


# Extra Practice

# smoker
sex = 0  # female
smoker = 1 # smoker

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children +  24000 * smoker - 12500
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated cost for being a female smoker instead of a female non-smoker is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")


# number of children
smoker = 0 # non-smoker
num_of_children = 0

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children +  24000 * smoker - 12500
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated cost for a female with no children instead of a female with three children is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
