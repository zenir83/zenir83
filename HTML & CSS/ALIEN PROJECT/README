This website is kind of an ode to when is was building html (CSS was still new) websites about my hobbies when I was a teenager. One of those was about the ALIEN movies. This
was back when Geocities still was around. We had a small but very active community of fans that made websites about the movies, comics, games. I saw ALIEN Resurrection
in theaters, which was awesome. This litte project is me practicing my gridbox and design skills. Also, because Photoshopm is way to expensive, I did my image manipulation in GIMP.
